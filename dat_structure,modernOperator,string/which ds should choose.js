// which data structure should choose
// there are 3 source of data 
//1. data in programe(source code), 2. from the ui 3. from web api

// 4 types of ds in js set,object,map,array
// if there is a simple list of value then we use set or array
// if it is key value pair then map or object
// in list type of data simply we have just value but in key value pair , in key we access the value
// geeting data from a web api , data from webapi are json formatted
//json is normally a long string but it can be converted into js object
// when to use what ds 
// for array : simple list of values when we do not need to describe values , or manipulate the data 
// set: simple list but unique value, use to remove duplicatetes from arrays, set is give high performance than array

// when we need to describe value in key value structure use object or maps
//object: traditional key value structure, and it has some technical disadvantages, this keyword is useful, use when u need to include function(methods)
//maps is better for key value store introduce in es6, also map keys can be any data type
//use when working with json(can be converted into map)
